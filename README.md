## Bedrock 2

Welcome to Bedrock. Bedrock is a prototyping environment to quickly build user interfaces.

Main features include

* Style guide ("design system"): see the components that are available to you
* Page tree: see the pages in your prototype in a handy side panel

## Create a Bedrock 2 based prototype

We recommend using degit to be able to grab a Bedrock install without actually cloning the project repository.

Here is the series of commands to use:

    npm i -g degit
    degit usebedrock/bedrock2 my-bedrock-2-project
    cd my-bedrock-2-project/
    npm install
    npm run dev

## Development on Bedrock 2 itself

To run the project:

    npm install
    npm run dev

## Requirements

* Node LTS
